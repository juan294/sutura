# Sutura: Verified Self-Healing CI

## One-liner

AI agents make CI pass. Sutura verifies the fix, filters flaky failures,
rejects unsafe shortcuts, and opens evidence-backed PRs for human review.
It reproduces real failures and races candidate repairs in isolated sandboxes.
"Sutura" means suture. It repairs the pipeline while preserving human approval.

## Context

Entry for the Nebius x NVIDIA Global AI Hackathon (deadline 2026-10-30,
track: Coding and Agentic Engineering; Tavily side prize targeted). Fit
analysis and timeline: `docs/research/2026-08-26-nebius-hackathon-fit.md`.
This repo is PUBLIC (MIT) from day 1 — never commit secrets, personal data,
or anything from Juan's private fleet.

## Stack

- TypeScript (pinned `^6` — typescript-eslint has no TS7 support), Node 22,
  pnpm, Vitest, ESLint flat config
- LLM: NVIDIA Nemotron models via Nebius Token Factory
  (OpenAI-compatible API, `https://api.tokenfactory.nebius.com/v1/`)
- Web grounding: Tavily API
- Env vars: `NEBIUS_API_KEY`, `TAVILY_API_KEY` — fail closed, never commit

## RPI Workflow

This project follows Research-Plan-Implement (RPI).

1. /research -- Understand the codebase as-is
2. /plan -- Create a phased implementation spec
3. /implement -- Execute one phase at a time with review gates
4. /validate -- Verify implementation against the plan

Each phase is its own conversation. STOP after each phase.
Use /clear between tasks, /compact when context is heavy.

## Key Commands

```bash
pnpm run test        # Vitest
pnpm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
pnpm run lint        # ESLint
pnpm run build       # tsc
```

## Git Workflow

- Integration branch (default): `develop`
- Production branch: `main` — releases and Devpost submission point here
- Implementation happens in git worktrees or temporary branches
- Verify current branch before committing; run typecheck + lint first
- Conventional commits:
  `feat|fix|test|refactor|chore|docs(scope): description`

```bash
# Commit before pulling (hook enforced)
git add <files> && git commit -m "msg"
git pull --rebase && git push
```

Run verification sequentially with `;` or `&&`, never as parallel Bash calls.

## Deployment

No hosted deployment. The artifact is a GitHub Action + CLI; releases are
tagged from `main`. Demo assets (video, sample runs) live in `docs/demo/`.

Rules load from `.claude/rules/` and `.claude/skills/` automatically.

## Agent Behavior

Exhaust tools before asking the user. Production actions need human
authorization. Save operational lessons to auto memory immediately.
Don't wait to be asked.
