# Error Patterns -- Top 20

**#1: Lost parallel verification results** --
Use `&&` or aggregate each exit status; bare `;` hides early failures.

**#2: Wrong worktree cwd** --
Bind each call to an observed worktree path or explicit workdir; verify branch.

**#3: Pre-commit hook rejection** --
Run typecheck/lint BEFORE committing. Fix first.

**#8: Tilde in file paths** --
Resolve an absolute path unless that specific file API promises expansion.

**#9: Push rejected (non-fast-forward)** --
Reconcile remote integration history locally, then rerun affected gates.

**#12: Push and forget CI** --
Inspect expected workflows for the authorized pushed commit.

**#13: Skipping TDD** --
Write the failing test FIRST. Red-Green-Refactor.

**#16: Dependencies not installed** --
Run `pnpm install` / `uv sync` before build/test/lint.

**#25: No upstream tracking** --
Working branches remain local; only completed integration may be published.

**#30: PR create before pushing** --
Do not publish a working branch merely to create a PR.

**#33: Pull rebase with dirty tree** --
Commit before `git pull --rebase`.

**#44: Push --tags pushes ALL tags** --
Push only the named authorized release tag: `git push origin v1.0.0`.

**#45: Fabricated filesystem paths** --
Never guess paths. Use Glob/Grep to find files first.

**#48: Commit/push to wrong branch** --
Run `git branch --show-current` before every commit.

**#49: Sub-agent git conflicts** --
Each sub-agent owns different files. Central commit.

**#51: CI explosion from parallel pushes** --
Integrate and verify locally; one authorized integration push may trigger several workflows.

**#56: Merge to main without topology** --
Ask: does merging to main deploy to production?

**#58: Deploy without preview verification** --
Run local runtime and platform preflights; never create Previews.

**#59: Improvised production recovery** --
Roll back immediately. Never deploy to diagnose.

**#62: Supabase migration without local test** --
Test role access with `supabase db reset --local`; remote application is separate.

  resolve the issue -- it points you at the right error number before you go
  looking for the full write-up.
