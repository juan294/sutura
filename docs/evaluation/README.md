# Sutura technical evaluation guide

Reviewed source: `ce3502d86a32883eac8c7a2adcc9df2c07e12e85`.
Inspection date: 2026-09-05. Scope: repository source, test definitions, and
committed evidence; this is not a fresh deployment or live-provider validation.

## The project in one minute

A green CI command can hide a deleted test, weakened assertion, or repair to the
wrong cause. Sutura investigates failing GitHub Actions and proposes an audited
repair for human review. Its [product workflow](../devpost/sutura-submission.md?plain=1#L40)
retains failure evidence and never merges the generated repair.

- **Controller authority:** the model proposes a bounded replacement; the
  controller selects its target and runs trusted verification.
  [Source and regression proof](architecture.md#controller-authority).
- **Reusable isolation:** dependency preparation feeds separate reproduction,
  repair, and audit branches. [ConTree evidence](architecture.md#contree-branches).
- **Layered audit:** mechanical checks, a fresh rerun, and semantic review can
  refuse a previously green candidate. [Audit evidence](architecture.md#layered-audit).

The latest committed live benchmark still fails repair and Tavily quality gates
and retains incomplete hidden verification. Read [evidence status](#evidence-status)
and [limitations](#limitations) before treating these mechanisms as release proof.
The [architecture cards](architecture.md) connect each claim to code and tests.

<a id="criteria"></a>
## Hackathon criteria

The [official rubric](https://nebiusglobalaihackathon.devpost.com/rules) provides
these four criteria.

| Criterion | Supported behavior | Evidence and limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Technological Implementation | Bounded proposals, isolated execution, independent audit | [Controller and audit cards](architecture.md#controller-authority); source and fixture tests do not establish live judgment quality. |
| Design | Case selection leads to an explained outcome, provenance, and rejected candidates | [Result renderer `renderResultBody`](../../packages/case-lab/src/render.ts#L347); this review did not test the hosted experience. |
| Potential Impact | Maintainers receive a diff and verification evidence before deciding to merge | [Audience](../devpost/sutura-submission.md?plain=1#L23) and [dogfood record](../demo/sutura-v0.2.0-phase-0-evidence.md?plain=1#L28); seeded cases and dogfooding do not establish adoption or measured time savings. |
| Quality of the Idea | Making CI green is tested against alternative patches and rejecting gates | [Counterfactual card](architecture.md#counterfactual-verification); the offline survivor and control-only Arena prevent a claim of complete safety or competitive superiority. |

## NVIDIA, Nebius, and Tavily roles

| Integration | Why used | Source or artifact and actual mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NVIDIA Nemotron through Nebius Token Factory | Separate diagnosis, proposal, and audit roles | [`DEFAULT_MODELS`](../../packages/core/src/config.ts#L10), [`createTokenFactoryClient`](../../packages/core/src/llm/token-factory.ts#L25): implemented runtime client; measured subjects remain in the reports below. Requested role and actual provider model are distinct. |
| Nebius ConTree | Share prepared dependencies while isolating execution branches | [`prepareSandbox`](../../packages/core/src/heal.ts#L483): runtime implementation; image availability and dependency support constrain execution. |
| Tavily | Ground dependency failures in release sources | [`ground`](../../packages/core/src/diagnose/tavily.ts#L500): runtime Search/Extract with validation; [versioned ablations](architecture.md#grounded-dependencies) retain failed arms. |
| Nebius Data Lab | Prepare sanitized evaluation data for later experiments | [Dataset and request](../datalab/README.md?plain=1#L3): preparation only; upload and batch inference remain pending. |
| NVIDIA ATIF / NeMo Agent Toolkit | Export interoperable sanitized trajectories and validate their shape | [Committed trajectory and validation command](../../README.md?plain=1#L350): offline validation; NeMo is not the live repair orchestrator. |

## Follow a Case Lab result

Open the [Case Lab](https://sutura-case-lab.vercel.app/), choose a case, and follow
these source-backed sections. [Replay provenance](../../packages/case-lab/replay/README.md?plain=1#L3)
distinguishes deterministic bundles from recorded-result fallback. The catalog's
[`expectedOutcomeFor`](../../packages/case-lab/src/cases.ts#L54) records expectations, not observations.

| Visible section | Renderer to inspect |
| --- | --- |
| Mode badge and failed commit / CI evidence | [`renderHeader`](../../packages/case-lab/src/render.ts#L164), [`renderEvidence`](../../packages/case-lab/src/render.ts#L185) |
| ConTree search tree and branch status | [`renderSearch`](../../packages/case-lab/src/render.ts#L214) |
| Rejected patches and rejection reasons | [`renderRejections`](../../packages/case-lab/src/render.ts#L252) |
| Clean audit branch and Ultra verdict | [`renderAudit`](../../packages/case-lab/src/render.ts#L273) |
| Accepted patch beside rejected alternatives, when attached | [`renderCounterfactual`](../../packages/case-lab/src/render.ts#L120) |

Empty search and “Not run” audit states describe that run's path. Text readers
can inspect the renderer and committed artifacts without the site or video.

## Evidence status

Canonical reports retain dates, corpus, denominators, outcomes, and identities.
Evidence was refreshed from integration snapshot
`61093a817dacf456b902f20c233436d6da27a604`; product source bytes are unchanged
from the reviewed source. Benchmark subjects, matrix Actions, and demo pins
remain separate identities.

| Evidence | Status and interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| [Latest repair-quality rerun, 2026-09-05](../demo/sutura-v0.2.1-repair-quality-evidence.md?plain=1#L13) | Live Placebo v0.2 corpus, 51 cases / 55 evaluations, subject `f5c3056acc96597f1ae11f411a3b9cfe03ba990f`: repair and Tavily gates fail; hidden verification retains three `not-run` cases. Zero observed false approvals does not make it release-ready. |
| [Candidate external matrix](../demo/sutura-v0.2.1-candidate-matrix.json#L1) | Live candidate-mode evidence on Action `ce3502d86a32883eac8c7a2adcc9df2c07e12e85`: `repository-policy-refusal` and `python-repair` fail; `ready` is false. This is not a public-release matrix or hosted-demo acceptance. |
| [Earlier v0.2.1 candidate](../demo/sutura-v0.2.1-phase-0-evidence.md?plain=1#L13) | Failed quality gates on `f8195e8a82ffe1527d755ae7ecb8a047484af9fa`; preserved as historical evidence. |
| [Historical v0.2.0 baseline and matrices](../demo/sutura-v0.2.0-phase-0-evidence.md?plain=1#L9) | Failed benchmark and both external matrices on release subject `a943ded4c734aed75c5c63f2b2dd63a2f44556c2`; includes unavailable Python-image failures. |
| [Counterfactual report](../demo/sutura-counterfactual-v0.2.json#L1) | Offline deterministic experiment; a visible-green, hidden-failing alternative survives. See [gate omissions](architecture.md#counterfactual-verification). |
| [Arena report](../demo/sutura-arena-v0.2.json#L1) | Scripted dummy/refuse-all controls exercise scoring; not a measured Sutura comparison. |
| [Demo identity](../../packages/case-lab/release.json#L1) | Action remains v0.2.0 at `a943ded4c734aed75c5c63f2b2dd63a2f44556c2`, separate from current source package v0.2.1 and later benchmark subjects. |

<a id="limitations"></a>
## Limitations and reproducing the review

Source inspection establishes implemented behavior; linked tests establish
existence, not a fresh pass. Live outcomes describe their measured subject.
Offline fixtures omit provider behavior; controls validate a harness; Data Lab
upload, batch inference, and final submission evidence remain separate work.
Zero false approvals does not mean every trap was caught: infrastructure and
unsuccessful outcomes remain in the [scoring denominator](../../packages/placebo/README.md?plain=1#L202).

Follow [contributor setup](../../README.md?plain=1#L235) and the existing
[offline replay commands](../../README.md?plain=1#L262). The documentation check
is `node --test scripts/submission-contract.test.mjs`; run project typecheck,
lint, tests, and build sequentially. These local checks do not measure live
repair quality. Final acceptance follows the [release evidence contract](../demo/sutura-v0.2.1-release-evidence-requirements.json#L1).

On refresh, review changed source bytes and update inspected references. Keep
reviewed source, historical benchmark subject, and demo Action identity separate;
a documentation commit cannot contain its own final hash.
