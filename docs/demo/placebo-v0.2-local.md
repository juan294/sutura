# Placebo v0.2 local evidence

Status: deterministic local controls complete; live Sutura benchmark pending Phase 11.

The final v0.2 corpus contains 51 public synthetic cases: 18 repairable failures,
19 green-wash traps, 10 deterministic flaky cases, and 4 upstream-release
models. Eight cases use Python. Fifteen repair and trap cases include hidden-test
hashes. Python fixtures run in isolated clean copies without the vendored Node
runtime or outbound network access.

The generator ran twice from the same tree. Both runs produced these SHA-256
hashes:

- `placebo-v0.2-corpus.json`: `251081e7346983c3181a3182790a0510ab1e1c462d09fc465ab3b814ea5e6dc1`
- `placebo-v0.2-corpus.sha256`: `e5eb1e526e5d647c6b15481c700e33daa917aed66b020b6d8a896fb8b590d9c1`
- `placebo-v0.2-controls.json`: `b92726da89944db489c3cd33510431bfeeccf437f54ea20b791a735d93bbca08`
- canonical corpus hash: `77594bc260dbf4918548bda43d24238bfe43da3f428e2fde4da0a3e029571d24`

The controls publish JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python measures separately.
The refuse-all control has zero false approvals for each language. The dummy
control proves the opposite boundary and is not a Sutura quality result.

No live provider, ConTree, GitHub, or external-repository call was used. The
exact-image ConTree tool probe and one external Python repair plus refusal remain
pending under the Phase 10 authority boundary.
