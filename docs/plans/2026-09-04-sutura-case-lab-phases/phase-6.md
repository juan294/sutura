# Phase 6: Live path in the demo repository, release pin, gate preparation

Issues: #51 (demo pinned to an exact release identity, tested against `v0.2.0`), #50 (public demo usable by a signed-out non-collaborator; prepared to the gate), #68 (demo README final text)

Depends on: Phases 3 and 5

## Goal

`juan294/sutura-demo` has a fail-closed `case-lab.yml` workflow that the dispatcher targets, pinned to the release identity in `packages/case-lab/release.json`, publishing public-safe result documents to the `case-lab-results` branch. Everything up to Gate A and Gate B is done, tested, and pushed; the gates themselves are recorded, not executed.

## Files in this repository

```

`uses:` cannot read `env` at the `uses` position in GitHub Actions; the pin is therefore a literal in the `uses:` line and `verify-pin` parses that literal. `SUTURA_ACTION_SHA` in `env` is kept equal to it for the shell steps; the contract test asserts both literals are identical.

Provider secrets appear only in the Action step (`with:`), never in `env:` of any other step; the contract test asserts that the string `secrets.` occurs only inside the `Action` step block (#63).

## `publish-result`

```ts
export async function publishResult(inputs): Promise<CaseLabResult>
  const case = caseLabCase(inputs.caseId)
  let caseFile: CaseFile | undefined; let replayedFrom
  if inputs.replayPath: bundle = parseReplayBundle(read); if bundle.actionSha !== release.actionSha -> throw
      if bundle.completeness.complete: ({ caseFile } = await replayBundle(bundle)); require caseFile.outcome === inputs.outcome
      else: caseFile = undefined  (result carries outcome and links only; page explains "bundle partial")
  outcome = inputs.outcome must be one of five outcomes (an empty Action output means infra-stop)
  cost: from caseFile when present, else { status: 'unavailable' }
  result = createCaseLabResult({ mode: 'live', requestId: inputs.requestId (validated), ... links from inputs (each publicGitHubUrl) })
  assertCaseLabResultPublicSafe(result, [process.env.NEBIUS_API_KEY, ...]) ; write with flag 'wx'
```

## Pin (#51)

- `release.json` holds `{ version: '0.2.0', actionSha: 'a943ded4c734aed75c5c63f2b2dd63a2f44556c2' }` (the current public release; `docs/demo/sutura-v0.2.0-phase-0-evidence.md:11`).
- `verifyPin({ workflowText, release })` asserts the `uses:` literal and `SUTURA_ACTION_SHA` equal `release.actionSha`; `case-lab verify-pin --tag v0.2.0` additionally runs `gh api repos/juan294/sutura/git/ref/tags/v0.2.0` (dereferencing an annotated tag to its commit) and `gh api repos/juan294/sutura-demo/contents/.github/workflows/case-lab.yml?ref=main` and asserts both agree with the committed copy. The unit test covers the parser; the networked check is run once in this phase and its output recorded in the notes.
- `demo-workflow.test.ts` asserts the committed copy under `packages/case-lab/demo/` parses, has exactly the two inputs, the five choice options equal `CASE_LAB_CASES` ids, the permission set is exactly the four listed, `id-token` is absent, the concurrency group is the static string `case-lab`, and the gate step precedes every checkout.

## Gate preparation (#50)

- `case-lab dispatch --base-url <url> --case <id>` posts to `/api/dispatch` and prints the request id and result URL (used by Gate B and by a maintainer smoke test).
- The plan's "Authorization gates" section holds the exact commands, cap, and expected cost; the notes file records the date the gate was presented.
- Push the demo repository changes to `main` with `CASE_LAB_ENABLED` unset, so the workflow refuses at its first step and no provider call is possible; verify with `gh workflow run case-lab.yml -R juan294/sutura-demo -f case-id=flaky-failure -f request-id=cl-0000000000000-00000000` that the run fails at the gate step within one minute (this dispatch is free: no checkout, no provider call).

## Verification

```bash
pnpm --filter @sutura/case-lab test && pnpm run typecheck && pnpm run lint && pnpm run build && pnpm run ci:fast
cd /Users/juan/code/sutura-demo && pnpm test && pnpm run typecheck && pnpm run lint && pnpm run verify:readme
node packages/case-lab/bin/case-lab.js verify-pin --tag v0.2.0
```

## Success criteria

- [ ] Demo workflow is fail-closed (disabled by default, input re-validation, daily cap, static concurrency, minimum permissions, secrets only in the Action step), with contract tests in both repositories.
- [ ] Pin verified against `v0.2.0`; `verify-pin` proves tag, file, and workflow agreement.
- [ ] Disabled dispatch proven on the real repository with a free run that fails at the gate step.
- [ ] Gate A and Gate B recorded with exact commands, cap, and expected cost.
